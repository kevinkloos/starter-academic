My name is Kevin Kloos, 23 years old from Katwijk, the Netherlands. In February 2021, I obtained my master's degree in Statistical Science at Leiden University. In the program, you can choose from different specialisations and I decided to follow the Data Science track. Besides Statistical Science, I also obtained the European Master of Official Statistics (EMOS): an extra degree on top of my master's degree. The EMOS program connected very well to my bachelor in Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management at Delft University of Technology. In the near future, I plan to follow a PhD program in Statistics and Data Science.

My working experience lays in teaching. I used to be a tutor for middle school and high school students for every subject I had a bit of knowledge. The last years at university, I was a Teaching Assistant for some master's courses. 

In my spare time, I like to play sports and games. From Football to FIFA to Fantasy Premier League: I do it and I follow it.
